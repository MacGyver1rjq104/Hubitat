# Hubitat Apps and Drivers
A collection of various Hubitat Apps and Drivers

# Drivers
The drivers to be used are under 'drivers/expanded', the drivers directly in 'drivers' can't be used on Hubitat. They contain code generation blocks executed by the Python scripts to create the final drivers residing in 'expanded'.

NOTE: 'tasmota-tuya-wifi-touch-switch-child-test' is NOT a real driver, do NOT use it.

# Apps
The drivers to be used are under 'apps'.

"Tasmota Connect" is used to install my drivers on HE.

NOTE: 'tasmota-connect-test' is NOT a real app, do NOT use it.

# Hubitat Forum

# Python scripts
The Python scripts used for generating the expanded source code and auto-publish to Hubitat are not meant to be used, but I have published them in case they are of some use to anyone. If you do use them, look me up at the Hubitat Forum user "markus" and I will happily listen to any feedback you may have.
